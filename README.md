# Automated Broadband Speed Tester & Tweeter - using Python & Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)
Created as a personal project to hone my skills using Python with Linux.
I recently purchased a Pi with the idea of setting up a number of automated tasks, for my personal use and to showcase my skills.

This particular script runs three times daily at 0700, 1300 and 1945, writes the results to a CSV file,
then tweets the speedtest results to my bot account. I was going to tag my ISP in the tweet however decided against it for now :)

In the future I'm going to add the results to a database and display then in graph form. TBC.
